Technologies: Qlik view, Mdx Query Generator for Qlik View,olap cube
Description
A scholarship project, as required by a professor, involves using QlikView for data analysis. The project aims to start with creating an OLAP cube to analyze communication trends. Once the OLAP cube is set up, it will be connected to QlikView via a connector to access the data. The final step involves creating visualizations and insights based on the communication trends data.

Key Features
1. Connect to OLAP Cube: Establish a connection to the OLAP cube containing communication trends data.
2. Manage Calculations: Perform and manage necessary calculations within the OLAP cube.
3. Connect QlikView to OLAP Cube: Utilize an MDX query generator to connect QlikView to the OLAP cube.
4. Create Visualizations and Interpretations: Develop insightful visualizations and interpretations based on the data accessed through QlikView.

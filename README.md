# QlikView Communication Trends OLAP Data Analysis
# The project is in master Branch
# Description
A scholarship project, as required by a professor, involves using QlikView for data analysis. The project aims to start with creating an OLAP cube to analyze communication trends. Once the OLAP cube is set up, it will be connected to QlikView via a connector to access the data. The final step involves creating visualizations and insights based on the communication trends data.
